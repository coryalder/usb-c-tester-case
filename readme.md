There are two versions of this design - one with a small tower to screw into to attach the acrylic top plate - and one without.

With screw tower:

Without screw tower:

The reason for that is that the tower is VERY delicate, and I wasn't able to screw into it without it snapping off. On my print, the acrylic top plate friction-fits perfectly, but your mileage may vary. Both models are provided in case you want to try your luck with the screw mount (try heating up the tower before screwing in the first time) or need one that will stay together even if dropped.

The screw hole is for an M3 screw, and the depth is 5mm so ideally a use a screw less than 7mm long (3mm for the plexy, 4mm into the tower).

The plexy top panel should be cut from 2.9mm acrylic.
